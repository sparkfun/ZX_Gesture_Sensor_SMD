[*ZX Gesture Sensor (13162)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13162)

The ZX Sensor works by bouncing infrared (IR) beams of light from the two LEDs on either side 
off of an object above the sensor. The bounced light returns to the receiver in the center of
the sensor, and a microcontroller on the back of the sensor interprets the data. We can read 
the results using an I2C or UART connection.
